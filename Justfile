# Build ds4-server and ds4-agent from the pinned submodule SHA (P1).
#
# STANDING RULE — recapture on every bump: whenever external/ds4's pinned SHA
# changes, golden fixtures MUST be recaptured against the freshly rebuilt
# binary before the bump lands. A rebase can apply cleanly and still be
# semantically wrong (the patch set instruments ds4_agent.c's decode loops and
# emitters). See BRIEF.md "The fork" and external/ds4/docs/fork-ledger.md.
